      <p>
        I don't know what to talk about this, Extraordinary A right? which
        indirectly the tagline describes the class I'm in right now. why does it
        have to be extraordinary? I don't know spontaneously just thought of it
        like that there is no special reason, see?. but let me tell you a little
        about this. my class is currently quite unique if you look closely, why
        not? my broos, ehem, I think are quite solid hub among them, especially
        the female ones bar - bar is the right word to explain it hahaha. they
        are always together wherever their leader goes, that's what my friend
        said. but I'm not going to talk about that. this class is quite cool
        with all the ridiculousness in it. especially her, who I call, what is a
        suitable designation for her? cutest? not suitable I guess, aah adorable
        might be more appropriate. god gave me a reason to get close to her
        hahahaha.

      <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
      <p>
        before us talking about my hobbies, we must know what hobby is right? i
        think A hobby is an activity that you do in your free time for enjoyment
        or pleasure. It's something that you're passionate about and that you
        engage in regularly, either alone or with others who share your
        interest. Hobbies can be creative, like painting or writing, or they can
        be more physical, like playing a sport or hiking. Some people have
        multiple hobbies, while others have one that they are particularly
        dedicated to. Hobbies can be a great way to relax, relieve stress, learn
        new skills, meet new people, and explore your interests and passions. so
        the point hobby is what you spend time just for to have fun, relieve
        your stress, and don't forget to learn new skills. after we know what
        hobby is let's talk about my hobby.
        <br /><br />Sasically my hobbies too random to share with you guys, why
        not? i really like to spend most of my free time just sleeping, and in
        power saving mode all the time. besides that i also like to watch anime
        of course, although it's not as addictive as it used to be. i like to
        read whether it's comics, novels, and general knowledge that interests
        me. i like reading as well as writing, maybe it's about tens approaching
        hundreds of writings, stories, quotes, poems that i have uploaded on
        social media, especially on tumblr. i might as well attach here my
        random writing is just 1, maybe haha. "I love the fact that I can make
        people happy, in any form. Even if it's just an hour of their lives, if
        I can make them feel lucky or make them feel good, or bring a smile to a
        sour face, that to me is worthwhile." pretty good right? i think it's
        enough guys.<br /><br />Overall, hobbies are a wonderful way to enrich
        one's life and to explore new interests and passions. They can bring a
        sense of fulfillment, enjoyment, and relaxation, and can help to balance
        out the stresses of daily life.

              Hi, my name is Ilham Azhar you guys can call me azhar and I'm
              excited to tell you a little bit about myself. I recently become a
              new student with a degree in information Tech from Politeknik
              Negeri Madiun. During my time in College, I had the opportunity to
              participate in a number of extracurricular activities that helped
              me develop strong leadership, teamwork, and communication skills.
              In my free time, I enjoy my hobbies. I'm a hard-working individual
              who is always looking for new challenges and opportunities to
              learn and grow. I'm excited to apply my skills and experience to a
              new role and make a positive impact. Just an image stttt.....
